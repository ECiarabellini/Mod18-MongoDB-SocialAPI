# Mod18-MongoDB-SocialAPI

## Description

MSU Coding Bootcamp Module 18 Challenge: NoSQL Challenge - Social Network API

The purpose of this project was to build from scratch an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, it also uses the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
